			<h1>Registry/gifts</h1>
			<p>As we have been living together for two years already, we have everything we need for our life together.
			As such, we do not have a registry for our wedding, and a gift is really not necessary.</p>
			<p>However, if you would like to contribute to our honeymoon fund, you are welcome to <a href="https://venmo.com/u/marksta">Venmo us.</a>

			<h1>Honeymoon</h1>
			<p>
				For our honeymoon, we plan to drive, backpack, camp, and climb our way up the Pacific coast of the US, provided it's not on fire.
				The tentative plan is to start in Phoenix and drive through California up to Seattle. Neither of us have spent much time
				in this part of the country, so we're eager to explore it.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you have any ideas for places we should go, people we should hang out with, or cool things to see, let us know at
				this <a href="https://forms.gle/DLMCUAgEUTd1URw89">Google form!</a>
